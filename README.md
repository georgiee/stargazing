# âœ¨ Stargazing for developers ðŸ’«
Hello, thanks for coming by. This is the repository for the presentation "Stargazing for developers".

It's build with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) but I highly customized it especially with scripts to control my interactive examples loaded in iframes. There are a lot of examples using SVG, CSS & JS.

I plan to explain some of my scripts and techniques here (reveal.js & from my presentation) once I held the presentation.

ðŸ‘‹ If you like what you see and if you can imagine working with me or being mentored by me,
