# âœ¨ Stargazing for developers ðŸ’«
Hello, thanks for coming by. This is the repository for the presentation "Stargazing for developers".

It's build with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) but I highly customized it especially with scripts to control my interactive examples loaded in iframes. There are a lot of examples using SVG, CSS & JS.

[Open Presentation](https://georgiee.github.io/stargazing)

Be aware that the internal script organization grew with the presentation. It's readable, but you'll find duplicate code and other workarounds to make it work for the presentation rather for you to look at.

The original presentation was build in 2019 and thankfully still compiles in 2023. 
There are some issues when you open the presentation in Firefox with the iframes not showing up the css animations and the virtual fragments are acting differently. Maybe something solved in future reveal.js version but out of scope for this talk.
