AnimateDash & Offset Intro: Mark lines I talk about.
ANimation Dash Offset: Ein offset zuviel irgendwo (pause)

Move this to a new slide:
> The simple rule to draw a line: Apply a dash array & offset with the length of the line then slowly animate the offset back to 0.


This slide has too much text:
> With all those information collected we know everything to make it work with CSS animation.

--
> We can now animate all lines, but this looks bad, as everything starts at the same time
apply animation delay when revealing the snippet

---
> To animate all lines in a constellation we have to apply our CSS animation. and we need to save the number of the created line (index)

Orion starts to animate one frame too early

---
play is not working when we come from very far slides away (which is normal). Reloading and trying works?
> We can use our function to easily create multiple constellations in the sky
