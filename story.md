Constellations are our next topic.

Let's start with a picture of random every day objects. We all know that those pictures show no living things
but our brain still recognize those characters and faces together with  an emotion.

My favourite ist the grumpy broom and the happy brush family.

That tendency to see faces in random data is called Pareidolia.

And what are stars in the sky? Random data and our brain tries hard to find anythign meaningful in it!

Just look at this random star pattern.

You can make some connection between stars to create a line drawing.

Which can transform to full blown image in your brain - thanks to pareidolia.

In this case it's Orion, a famous hunter from the greek mythology.

There are exactly 88 official constellations in our night sky covering an imaginary sphere around the earth.

Constellations are usually visualized with dots and lines, which brings us to our next fact!

We want to create and animate a line drawing like this and place it in our night sky.
