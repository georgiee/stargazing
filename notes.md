no design, web 2.0, skeuomorphism (realism, mimic real-world objects), flat design/ minimalism (almost like no design?, sacrifice users’ needs for the sake of trendy aesthetics), semiflat/material design (a more mature and balanced interpretation of flat design has emerged, more gradients)


way beyond it
tip of the icerberg


you are not the user

empathy - we are building websites for us
but what about elderly people, inaccessible people,

problem solving, searching

git is a beast many people don't dare to tame


no google (1998), no wikipedia (2001), no stackoverflow (2008)

brutal life of a frontend developer

impostor syndrome gets everyone — lack of confidence and the thinking
you are a snowflake doign things other people doing far better.


Ember, Backbone, Knockout
disappeared almost entirely within 4 years
compaere this with a 


IE?
Now it has moved to Chromium



challanges:

HTML + CSS, HTML + CSS + JS

cross browser: far more complex in eralier days,
devops/hosting, complex application/business logic, testing, performance
wiht power comes responsibiloty: security/xss
accessibility

tasks:
naturally the backend with node js
full stack vs the specialize frontend developer


loading performance
accessibility
maintaiability
SEO

flexibility for changes (agile anyone?)

privacy:
dropping in google analytics is easy, the privacy consequences are not
dropping in ads is easy the implicated prviacy consequences are not


challenges:
fast pace, although it was never better than today
still, it's technology, you need to stay curious

freedom:
there are amazing editors and IDE's like Sublime, TextMate, VSCode, IntelliJ
but it's still enough to use a text editor these days

there is a solution available to many problem's:
stackoverflow, npm libraries, github gists somewher else in the internet.


webmaster web designer today apps in web, 
we are the proud bridge builders to the users, 
what we build is directly touched by the user

eraly years honest and functional design, osx imiates real material, then minimal  today somehow backwards

web was easy to understand, you could learn by just looking at the source code. today complexity is huge and you can only understand parts by looking st the source code. Web Assembly is my worst nightmare when I imagine that the web could end like this. Nonkid will ever learn again from a website.
